*irc-client usage*
----
Konversation:
For native internal command call:
  * first link or move inxi into [http://code.google.com/p/inxi/wiki/Installation Konversation's script folder]
  * then run:
     * /inxi -`<`[http://code.google.com/p/inxi/wiki/inxi option]`>`
For normal external script call, in Konversation session:
  * type: 
    * /cmd inxi -`<`[http://code.google.com/p/inxi/wiki/inxi option]`>`
    * example: /cmd inxi -d
and you'll see the expected output.
----
Quassel:
inxi ships as a built in script with Quassel, so you should just be able to run the standard builtin command to run an internal script. 
----
X-Chat:
  * /exec -o inxi -`<`[http://code.google.com/p/inxi/wiki/inxi option]`>`
    * the -o option show output to the channel.  Without it, only the user will see the output.
----
`WeeChat`:
  * you can install shell.py in one of these ways if you don't already have it:
    * download the [http://weechat.flashtux.org/plugins.php plugins package], then you can choose only the shell.py script (the only required script to run inxi). To install this,  follow the directions on `WeeChat` http://www.weechat.org)
    *  Run this command inside of weechat: /weeget install shell.py
  * then, once you have shell.py installed, run:
     * /shell -o inxi -`<`[http://code.google.com/p/inxi/wiki/inxi option]`>`
        * the -o option show output to the channel.  Without it, only the user will see the output.

 * Alternate Solution
There no longer seems to be need for plugins as above

Click on the download button at
http://www.weechat.org/scripts/source/stable/shell.py.html/

Make the script executable by
{{{
chmod +x shell.py
}}}
Move it to folder..................~/.weechat/python/autoload/

Next time you open weechat at top of screen, you will see shell is loaded and then you can run
{{{
/shell -o inxi (option)
}}}

----
irssi and most other clients
  * /exec -o inxi -`<`[http://code.google.com/p/inxi/wiki/inxi option]`>`
  * example: 
{{{
/exec -o inxi -dn
}}}
