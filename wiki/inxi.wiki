#summary Explanation of all current inxi options. See inxi_usage for how to use these options in various clients, irc etc.
=Inxi Options=
Inxi has a wide range of options and custom triggers, along with useful defaults like -b or -F. Plain inxi, no options, prints a single line of basic system information.

Here is a screenshot of typical output for inxi -Fz (-z filters certain output like IP numbers and Mac address of network card, things that don't need to be publically displayed for security reasons). The display output has changed slightly as of 1.7.x:

==Full List of Inxi Options==
 * inxi supports the following options. These options are included as of inxi 1.7.5. Earlier versions may not have every option. You can combine these options, or list them one by one: Examples: inxi -v4 -c6 OR inxi -bDc 6

 * If you start inxi with no arguments, it will show the short form. The following options if used without -b, -F or -v  + number will show just that complete line:
   * A,C,D,G,I,M,N,P,S,f,i,n,o,p,l,u,r,s,t - you can use these together or alone to show just the line(s) you want to see.
   * If you use them with either a -v + level, a -b, or with -F, it will show the full output for that line along with the output for the chosen verbosity level.
   * NOTE: as of version 1.6.5, the old basic output option -d was changed to -b, for basic. -d is now used for the extended disk option, showing cdrom/dvd information as well.

 * Output Control Options:
  * -A  Show Audio/sound card information.
  * -b  Shows basic (b for basic) output, short form. Same as: inxi -v 2 (version 1.7.5 or later. Earlier versions use: -d). Shows -S -M  -C -G -N -D (short form), and -I
  * -c  Available color schemes. Scheme number is required. Color selectors run a color selector option prior to inxi starting which lets you set the config file value for the selection.
    * Supported color schemes: 0-32 Example: inxi -c 11
    * Supported color selectors. NOTE: irc and global only show safe color set. (version 1.5.x or later only)
      * 94 - Console, out of X
      * 95 - Terminal, running in X - like xTerm
      * 96 - Gui IRC, running in X - like Xchat, Quassel, Konversation etc.
      * 97 - Console IRC running in X - like irssi in xTerm
      * 98 - Console IRC not in  X
      * 99 - Global - Overrides/removes all settings. Setting specific removes global.
  * -C  Show full CPU output, including per CPU clockspeed.
  * -D  Show full hard Disk info, not only model, ie: /dev/sda ST380817AS 80.0GB.
  * -f  Show all cpu flags used, not just the short list. Not shown with -F to avoid spamming.
  * -F  Show Fuller output for inxi, includes all upper case line arguments, plus -n and -s. Does not show extra verbose options like -d -f -u -l -p  -t or -o unless you add them explicitly, for example: -Fplo
  * -G  Show Graphic card information (card, x type, resolution, version). Also shows glx renderer, card pci busID with -x. Shows active/unloaded/failed driver versions (1.5.x or later)
  * -i  Show Wan IP address, and shows local interfaces (requires ifconfig network tool). Same as -Nni
        * If you are going to use this for public posting of  your data, consider running it with the -z option for filtering. IRC filters by default. 
  * -I (upper case i) Show Information: processes, uptime, memory, irc client, inxi version.
  * -l (lower case l, el) Show partition labels. Default: short partition -P. For full -p output, use: -pl (or -plu).
  * -M  Show machine data. Motherboard, Bios, and if present, System Builder (Like Lenovo) (version 1.6.x and later).
  * -n  Show Advanced Network card information. Same as -Nn. Shows interface, speed, mac id, state (version 1.5.x and later).
  * -N  Show Network card information. Shows card and driver. Includes support for USB networking devices. Also shows busID/USB-ID, ports, driver version with -x
  * -o  Show unmounted partition information (includes UUID and LABEL if available).
        * Shows file system type if you have file installed, if you are root OR if you have added to /etc/sudoers (sudo v. 1.7 or newer): 
              * < username > ALL = NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/file (sample)
  * -p  Show full partition information (-P plus all other detected partitions).
  * -P  Show Partition information (shows what -v 4 would show, but without extra data).
    * Shows, if detected: / /boot /home /tmp /usr /var. Use -p to see all mounted partitions.
  * -r  Show distro repository data. Currently supported repo types: 
        * APT (Debian, Ubuntu + derived versions)
        * PACMAN (Arch Linux + derived versions)
        * PISI (Pardus + derived versions)
        * YUM. (Fedora, Redhat, maybe Suse + derived versions)
        * (as distro data is collected more will be added. If your's is missing please show us how to get this information and we'll try to add it.)
  * -s  Show sensors output (if sensors installed/configured): mobo/cpu/gpu temp; detected fan speeds.
    * Gpu temp only for Fglrx/Nvidia drivers. Nvidia shows screen number for > 1 screens

  * -t  Show processes. Requires extra options: c (cpu) m (memory) cm (cpu+memory). 
        * If followed by numbers 1-20, shows that number of top process for each selection (default: 5): 
        * Examples: 
             * -t cm10 (shows top 10 cpu and memory processes, 20 in all)
             * -t c (shows top 5 cpu processes)
             * -t m20 (shows top 20 memory processes)
             * -t cm (shows top 5 cpu and memory processes, 10 in all)
        * Make sure to have no space between letters and numbers (cm10 -right, cm 10 - wrong).
  * -u  Show partition UUIDs. Default: short partition -P. For full -p output, use: -pu (or -plu).
  * -v  Script verbosity levels. Verbosity level number is required. Note: do not mix -v options with -b or -F, use one or the other.
    * Supported levels: 0-5 Example: inxi -v 4

=Inxi Information=
inxi is a system information script.  The code base was forked from infobash.  All code has been reworked and put into functions.  Then, as requested by users, more information was made available as additional functions.  inxi is useful to system admins for identifying hardware on remote system, it is useful for desktop users, but is most helpful in irc when support services would like to know customers hardware for troubleshooting issues.
